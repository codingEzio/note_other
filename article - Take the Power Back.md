- Switching off is good advice. But eventually, you’ll be back. 
    > How about changing? 
    >> Changing from passive, to active. 
    >>> From scroll to search,<br>
    >>> from react to rethink,<br>
    >>> from like and retweet to write and link.
    >>>> ***Take the power back.***
  
- And no, you can’t escape digital culture as long as you live in a society that lives on digital fuel.
    - If you block the email you’ll have trouble holding onto most jobs.
    - If you have no cellphone people just won’t get in touch with you anymore.
    - However long your digital Sabbatical, you will inevitably get sucked back in. 

- ... And so will your kids.

- But instead of protecting them from the *evil* internet, 
    - teach them to read, write, draw, paint, ask and think.
    - Teach them researching, blogging, FTP.

- The challenge when you are *in* is to not become **passive**.
    - To change from consumer to maker, following to self-thinking, quoter to commentator, liker to publisher, 
    - but mostly, from getting angry about headlines of articles you haven’t read to reading precisely, asking questions, researching, fact-checking, thinking clearly and writing carefully.

- Writing to get real when it is read. Before that, it is a dream in letters.
    - Writing to get read makes you careful, responsible, and considerate.
    - It forces you to think about how what you say may look and feel from the outside.

- Writing to be read may not be desirable for everybody.
    - But if you feel that you have something to say, write to be read. 
    - Don’t search for something you want  to write because you want to be famous or rich.

- ... And when finacial institutions start mixing the cards, you have no chance.

- The answer to the passive consumption of trash is the active formulation of questions, the active search for answers and the active work of putting complex knowledge and diffuse feelings into clear words.

- Unlike getting fed from those feeds, searching, researching, reflecting, and concise writing has the power to clear the mind.

- We need to write on our own domains. Don’t post thoughts on Facebook. Use it to get traffic.
- Drop Medium for blogging. Own your writing. 
- Use Twitter carefully. 
- And on your own domain, send people to other domains you like, outside the usual black holes, if possible.
