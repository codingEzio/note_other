### Let’s start 
- Ya need *Java*, that’s for sure :D 
    - something like ```JAVA_HOME```, ```CLASSPATH```
    - the env is fine, but do make sure to uncomment the ```export CLASSPATH```
- Install stuff we’ll need (on **macOS**)
    - ```brew update && brew install clojure && brew install leiningen```
- Gen a new project 
    - ```lein new mynewprojet```
