### Right on

- It’s a common belief that ideas from, say, 
    > <q>*quantum physics or behavioral neuroscience are headache-inducing and hard to understand*</q>. 
    >> This is True, but it took me years to realize its ture for **everyone** 
    >>> —— this stuff is *supposed* to be hard to understand, even for experts.
    
- It’s easy for me to forget that humankind is still really, really young. 
    > Brutus gutted Caesar with a knife only 60\~70 generations ago,
    
    >> and it’s probably been only \~300 generations <br>since our nomadic ancestors decided to stop chasing deer and settle down to grow crops.
    
    > <q>In other words, our bodies aren’t <q>designed</q> for modern life at all</q>.
    
    >> We humans didn’t evolve to think about cryptocurrency, 
    >>> or thogonal matrices, <br>or interplanetary space travel, 
    
    >>> which means these stuff are really, really hard for us, ***naturally***.
    
- The more complex and abstract an idea is, <br>the more metaphors we’ll need to <q>stack</q> on top of each other to understand it. 
    
- Start with intuition & metaphor before layering in rigor & abstraction.

- Quotes from *Richard Feynman*:
    > We are at the very beginning of time for the human race.
    
    > It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. <br>But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. 
    
    >> Our responsibility is to do what we can,<br>learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.
